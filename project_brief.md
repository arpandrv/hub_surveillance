## Robust Mango Pest and Disease Surveillance through an Interactive Web Application

### Background
Australian agriculture contributes 10.8% of the country's goods and services exports. Unfortunately, millions of dollars are lost each year due to pests or plant diseases. Robust plant surveillance data can help Australian growers and governments improve the prevention and management of potentially catastrophic pests and plant diseases. But how do we know that growers have adequately surveyed plants within their property?

### Project Goal
At the end of this project, you will develop an interactive, easy-to-use Web application that can be used by growers to calculate the surveillance effort required to be undertaken on their property to provide assurance that they would detect a pest or disease if it was present.

There are two project objectives as described below.

### Objective 1
*This is to be completed as Assessment 2.*

Build an informative but static website using Django that provides information about known pests and plant diseases affecting mangoes which require growers' surveillance. A static website does not collect information from users and does not store any information on a database.

### Objective 2
*This is to be completed as Assessment 4.*

Develop the output of Objective 1 into an interactive web application using Django that can be used by growers to calculate the surveillance effort required to be undertaken on their property. The tool needs to be developed with the following considerations:

- The number of plants on the grower's property
- Location of the surveyed plants
- The time of surveillance
- The tool needs to be flexible enough to be expanded to other types of plants in the future
- The tool will be used by growers who are generally aged between 40 and 60 years old
- Different pests/diseases may infect different parts of a plant, so the tool should consider surveillance of different parts of the plant
- Different farms may have different stocking rates
- The surveillance data should be able to record surveillance results by different growers and maintain historical surveillance data
