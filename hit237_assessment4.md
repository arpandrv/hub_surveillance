# S125 HIT237 BUILDING INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE

## 4. Group Project Report 2 (Group: 40%)

### About

This assessment should be completed in your existing group. Individual submissions will not be accepted.

In this assignment, you will use Django to build a highly interactive website that addresses the requirements outlined in the Project Brief document.

The website will utilise a database to record and retrieve information. You may consider this a significant enhancement to your previous Django assessment submission.

The website must provide full C.R.U.D. functionalities (Create, Read, Update and Delete) for the records within your database. This is akin to building your version of the Django Admin App, which deals exclusively with the maintenance of your data.

More details about your tasks are given in the following section.

### Tasks

Address the Objective 2 of the Project Brief document. Ensure that your website meets the following criteria:

* Be created with Django version 5.0 or later, containing at least one Django app.
* Improvises the website structure previously produced for Objective 1.
* Navigation options that provide easy access to the website's homepage and other logical or helpful URLs within your project. The navigation options should be available at all times throughout your website.
* Use Django to store your information dynamically in a local database.
* Use Django ModelForms on your website to accept the user input that will affect the database.
* Full CRUD functionality is available on your website for each table (entity) in your data model.
* All hyperlinks must be constructed using named URL Paths and {% url %} template tag. Any hyperlink that points to resources outside of your website project is exempt from this requirement.
* The website should use standard HTML5 syntax and essential HTML formatting, such as headers, tables, hyperlinks and text formatting where appropriate.
* The minimum data complexity requirement must be met (a minimum of 3 related classes/tables in your data model).
* Data model classes must include the supporting structure for the relationships between the classes. For example, models.ForeignKey(…) and/or models.ManyToManyField(…).
* A sample data set containing at least 10 surveillance records must be supplied with the project submission.

### Submissions

Submit your work via Learnline no later than the stated due date of this assignment.

A single .zip file containing your Django project that addresses the above tasks. Exclude the virtual environment folder from this file.

A 12-minute recorded presentation on MS Teams by all team members. The presentation should be divided into two segments:
* 7 minutes of Django app demo, covering all features.
* 5 minutes explaining individual contribution by each team member.
* Copy and paste the presentation as a YouTube link (when uploading the video to YouTube, set it as "unlisted" so that it is not publicly searchable)

A copy of the signed AI Usage Declaration Form:
* Include clear acknowledgement of the use of generative AI.
* A reflective account of the use of generative AI in the project, accompanied by well-documented prompts and interaction evidence.
* Please use the following template: AI Usage Declaration Form.docx

Other notes:
* No written report is required.
* Do not submit your work by email.

### Unacceptable Elements of Submissions

You must not reuse the codes from our class exercises and lecture slides. They are your instructor's codes, not yours. Your instructor can quickly tell his codes from others. Reusing your instructor's codes may constitute an academic breach. Teams that do not comply with this will not receive a mark for the affected components.

You must not obtain, re-use, or modify existing Web templates (including HTML templates) obtained from elsewhere.

You must not use any other Web framework than what is taught in this unit.

### Submissions that Do Not Run

It is the student's responsibility to ensure that their submissions run on the instructor's computer as intended, including cases where additional Python packages need to be imported. Submissions that fail to run will be severely marked down.

It is recommended that you simulate a submission with your peers before making the final submission.
* Make sure you are using the correct Django version
* Make sure you have included all required files and Python packages
* Make sure your .zip file is valid before you upload it to Learnline

### Originality

Do not plagiarise from other student groups.

Do not engage in contract cheating. Providing contract cheating services is a criminal offence in Australia, punishable by imprisonment and/or hefty fines. Reference: [https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/media-item/cheating-the-system/](https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/media-item/cheating-the-system/)

You may choose to use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek or others) to brainstorm or assist with generating non-critical elements of your Python code. You must be able to demonstrate a clear understanding of all elements of your code and their functionality if further required.

Violating the originality requirement may constitute a serious breach of academic integrity, leading to significant loss of marks or even not passing the unit.

### Individual Marks

This unit is committed to ensuring that each team member contributes his or her fair share of the group work.

All student have the responsibility to clearly document their contributions. Failure to provide satisfactory evidence of individual contributions may result in loss of marks or not passing this assessment for the student involved.

All teams must document their creative process on Microsoft Teams and GitHub/BitBucket. Other platforms (WhatsApp, Facebook, Discord, etc.) should not be used as evidence, without any prior agreement with the campus lecturer. The group mark may not be released to the students if this collaborative requirement is not met by the submission due date.

Evidence from Microsoft Teams and GitHub/BitBucket may be used to further differentiate individual marks. Your instructor reserves the right to differentiate individual grades where appropriate.

If in doubt, please contact your campus lecturer.
